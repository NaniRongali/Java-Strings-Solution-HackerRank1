Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:

Sum the lengths of  A and B.
Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B  come before  in the dictionary?).
Capitalize the first letter in A  and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
Input Format

The first line contains a string A. The second line contains another string B. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

Output Format

There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of A  and B.
For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater B than  otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both  and  and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Sample Input 0

hello
java
Sample Output 0

9
No
Hello Java
Explanation 0

String  is "hello" and  is "java".

 has a length of , and  has a length of ; the sum of their lengths is .
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore,  is not greater than  and the answer is No.

When you capitalize the first letter of both  and  and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".
